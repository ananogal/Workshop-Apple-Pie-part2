# Apple Pie

## About
In this word-guessing game, the player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree. The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone.

### Step 2: Start a new round with 7 apples in the tree.

- Go to ViewController.swift
- Create a function named startNewRound.
- Set the image of the treeImageView to "Tree 7"
- Create a constant maximumAttempts and set it to 7
- Using string interpolation, use this variable to get the number 7 of the text "Tree 7"
- Build and run the app.
