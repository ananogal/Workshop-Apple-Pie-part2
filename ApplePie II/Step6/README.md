# Apple Pie

## About
In this word-guessing game, the player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree. The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone.

### Step 6: Set the text of ```scoreLabel``` to show wins and looses

- Go to ViewController.swift
- Set the text of the ```scoreLabel``` to “Wins: 0 Looses: 0”.
- Add a variable to track the wins.
- Add a variable to track the looses
- Use String interpolation to use the values of these variables in the text of the ```scoreLabel```
- Build and run the app.
- Refactor your code by creating a function to hold the loop of buttons
- Continue refactoring your code making a new function ```updateUI``` that will have all updates to the UI.
- Build and run the app.
